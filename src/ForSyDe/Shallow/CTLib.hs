-- It is still experimental.
-- Right now there are only constructors 'combCT', 'combCT2', 'delayCT', 
-- 'shiftCT', 'mealyCT', 'mooreCT', 'scaleCT', 'addCT', 'multCT' and 'absCT'.
--
-- The main idea is to represent continuous time signals as functions
-- @Real --> a@ with @a@ being a numerical type. This allows us to represent a 
-- continuous time signal without loss of information because no sampling or 
-- ADC is required. The sampling occurs only when a signal is evaluated, 
-- for instance when it is plotted. 
-- 
-- Thus, a /signal/ is represented as a sequence of functions and intervals. For
-- instance a signal 
-- 
-- @s = \<(sin,[0,100])\>@ 
--
-- represents a sinus signal in the interval between 0 and 100. The signal 
--
-- @s2 = \<(f1(x)=2x, [0,2]), (f2(x)=3+x,[2,4])\>@
--
-- defines a signal that is defined by function @f1@ in the interval @[0,2]@ 
-- and by function @f2@ in the interval @[2,4]@. 
--
-- A /process/ transforms the incoming functions into outgoing functions. 
-- The approach is described in more detail in the ANDRES deliverable D1.1a.
-- Here we only briefly comment the main functions and constructors.

-- | applyG1 is used to apply a next-state function. A very interesting
-- question is, what should be an argument to the next-state function: 
-- the incoming function, defining the value of the input signal?
-- or the incoming function and the incoming interval?
-- or the value of the incoming signal at a particular point, e.g. at the 
-- left most point of the interval?
-- To give the next-state function the interval itself as argument, would mean
-- that the process becomes time variant process, i.e. its behaviour is 
-- dependent on the absolute time values. This is not a good thing to have!
-- Another possibility may be to give a sub-signal that is relative to the 
-- current evaluation, i.e. the left most point is always 0. Would that make
-- sense?

-- Functions to display and plot signals:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
{- $plotdoc
   Several functions are available to display a signal in textual or 
   graphics form. All displaying of signals is based on sampling and 
   evaluation the signal at regular sampling points. 

   The function 'sample' evaluates the signal and returns a list of 
   (time,value) pairs, which can be displayed as text or used in any other way.
   
   'showParts' does not evaluate the signal; it only shows how it is 
   partitioned. Hence, it returns a sequence of intervals.
  
   'plot', 'plotCT' and 'plotCT'' can plot a signal or a list of signals 
   in a graph. They use @gnuplot@ for doing the actual work.
   They are in the IO monad because they write to the file system.
  
   'plot' is defined in terms of 'plotCT' but it uses the default sampling 
   period 'timeStep' and it can plot only one signal in a plot.
  
   'plotCT' can plot a list of signals in the same plot.
   'plotCT' is defined in terms of 'plotCT'' but uses 
   default label names for the plot.

   'vcdGen' writes the values of signals in Value Change Dump (VCD) format to 
   a file. There are public domain wave viewers which understand this format 
   and can display the signals.

   'plotCT'' is the work horse for plotting and the functions 'plot' and 
   'plotCT' use it with specialising arguments.

   'plotCT'' plots all the signals in the list in one graph. If a label is
   given for a signal, this label appears in the graph. If the label string is 
   \"\", a default label like \"sig-1\"  is used.

   In addition to displaying the graph on the screen, the following files
   are created in directory .\/fig:

   [ct-moc-graph.eps]          an eps file of the complete graph

   [ct-moc-graph.pdf]          A pdf file of the complete graph
 
   [ct-moc-graph-latex.eps]    included by ct-moc-graph-latex.tex

   [ct-moc-graph-latex.tex]    This is the tex file that should be included
                               by your latex document. It in turn includes
 			       the file ct-moc-graph-latex.eps.
			       These two files have to be used together;
 			       the .eps file contains only the graphics,
			       while the .tex file contains the labels and

{- Some performance tests on my laptop under cygwin:

***********************************************************************
With ghc:

with 
toneA = sineWave (440.0) (0, 2.0)
toneE = sineWave 520.0 (0, 2.0)

****
we make testAll with Double data types on

ghc --make CTLib.hs -O3 -o ttt.exe
time ttt
   
real    0m33.749s
user    0m0.010s
sys     0m0.010s

****
we make testAll with Rational data types on

ghc --make CTLib.hs -O3 -o ttt.exe
time ttt
   
real    0m53.687s
user    0m0.010s
sys     0m0.010s

****
hence the performance penalty when using Rational instead of Double is
1.59 (60%) longer delay.


************************************************************************
On hugs: (when using 0.2 second long waves, hugs aborted with an out of memory 
message both with Double and Rational; but with Double it aborted much faster;)

toneA = sineWave (440.0) (0, 0.02)
toneE = sineWave 520.0 (0, 0.02)

****************
**** with Double:
time runhugs.exe -h500k CTLib.hs

real    0m1.702s
user    0m0.020s
sys     0m0.010s

******************
**** with Rational:

time runhugs.exe -h500k CTLib.hs

real    0m21.501s
user    0m0.010s
sys     0m0.020s

****************
hence we have a factor of 12.5 longer delay with Rational compared to Double.
