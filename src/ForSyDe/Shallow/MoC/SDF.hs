-------------------------------------

-- | The process constructor 'delaySDF' delays the signal one event
--   cycle by introducing an initial value at the beginning of the
--   output signal.  Note, that this implies that there is one event
--   (the first) at the output signal that has no corresponding event at
--   the input signal.  One could argue that input and output signals
--   are not fully synchronized, even though all input events are
--   synchronous with a corresponding output event. However, this is
--   necessary to initialize feed-back loops.
delaySDF :: a -> Signal a -> Signal a
delaySDF x xs = x :- xs


-- | The process constructor 'delaynSDF' delays the signal n event
--   cycles by introducing n initial values at the beginning of the
--   output signal.
