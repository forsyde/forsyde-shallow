 ForSyDe's Haskell-embedded Domain Specific Language.
 ====================================================

DESCRIPTION

 The ForSyDe (Formal System Design) methodology has been developed
 with the objective to move system design to a higher level of
 abstraction and to bridge the abstraction gap by transformational
 design refinement.
 
 This library provides ForSyDe's implementation as a Haskell-embedded
 Domain Specific Language (DSL). 

 For more information, please see ForSyDe's website:
